What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

0 at first a repository is just an ordinary directory
1 with the command "git init" (prompt on the directory location)
  a hidden file named .git is created
2 that file has metadata about the directory which is now a repository
3 the hidden file can be see with the command "ls -a"
4 the status of the repository can be see with the command "git status"
5 at first there are no commits
6 this is because I may want to change the contents of the repository
  (a directory with the .git file) BEFORE I commit for the first time

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

1 you add files to the virtual staging area with the command "git add 'filename.xxx'"
2 with the command "git status" it can be see that the files now appear as "new file"
  (instead of "untracked file")
3 the new files will be added to the repository in the NEXT commit
4 it is possible to remove files from the staging area with the command "git reset 'filename.xxx'"
5 this offers a greater level of control about what is and isn't added in the commits
