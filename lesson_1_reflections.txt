How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

1 It dramatically reduced the amount of text to search
2 Made it easy to search the remaining text

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

1 Makes is easier to analyse the evolution of the code if revisiting it after a long time of concluding the program
2 Allows you get back previous code that was changed for some reason but that you now realize that can be useful in some other way

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

1 Pros: total control which allows to commit logically
2 Cons: automatic saving is safer and more carefree

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

1 Git allows saving multiple files which is more convenient for programmers
2 Google Docs and others do not have that feature for they are more oriented towards generic documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

1 With git log we can CHECK which commits exist and get their corresponding id
2 With git diff we can COMPARE two commits using their ids

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

1 I would do the changes anyway...
2 ...but version control makes it much more efficient to track the progress and find problems

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

1 well...
2 ...for what it's for, version control of my programs
